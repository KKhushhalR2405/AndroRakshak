# Android Malware Detection

Nowadays, the popularity of the mobile platform grows, so will the pool of potential victims in the eyes of malware authors, especially in Android platform. Even, Google has taken steps to protect Android consumers, providing better security tools for Android developers but malware developers can sometimes upload compromised apps faster than Google can block them. Moreover, many kinds of Android applications require to many permissions than which they need to provide userâ€™s services. Once smart phones are infected with malware, users may face the following risks: disclosure of personal information, sent messages and read communications without permission, exploited the data with malicious intent. In this project, we introduce a method to evaluate the security level of Android applications based on their permission. The method, which is called PAMD: Permission analysis for Android malware detection, analyses the Android Manifest file by understanding the protection level of Android permission and investigating malicious characteristics.
